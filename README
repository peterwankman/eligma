An implementation of an Enigma machine in the object oriented language C.

This program is an exercise in writing a program in C that uses classes as a
means of implementing object oriented programming. As of now, all members
are public. Private members could be easily implemented using forward decla-
rations, but that wasn't neccessary here.

This program is based on the video series "Coding the Enigma machine" from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbm2dmkmqgQ

The Python source code I typed in from the videos is found in python/. As
fas as I can see, the original author didn't release it under any particular
license. So I'm providing it as is. For information about licensing, consult
the author.
